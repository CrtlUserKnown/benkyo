# Benkyo (Benkyo is Study in Japanese)

## For Development

### Prerequisites

This project will utilize [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 
for development for the frontend of the application. However, the backend
will be written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and Xcode will not be 
needed for that. 

For the creation of this app, development will be done in git branches.
git branches will make it easier will make changes and track changes 
throughout the development process. To get started, take a look at the 
branches and make sure to switch to or create the branch you want to work in.

#### Here are some examples:

```sh
# take a look at the branches
git branch -v

# switch to a branch
git checkout feat/backend

# create git branch
git checkout -b feat/frontend

```

To submit any changes, create a pull request.

```sh
# create a pull request
git request-pull origin/main feat/backend

```
